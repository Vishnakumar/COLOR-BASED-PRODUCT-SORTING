An embedded system project that automatically detects and sorts objects based on their color(RGB values) using TCS3200 color sensor and arduino sensor into the correct container using servo motors. It automates repetitive color-based sorting tasks efficiently.

Components Used

* Arduino Nano,
* TCS3200 Color Sensor,
* 2x Servo Motors,
* Jumper Wires,
* 5V Power Supply,

Working Principle
1. Object is placed under the color sensor.
2. TCS3200 reads RGB frequency values.
3. Arduino processes the values using threshold logic.
4. Based on detected color, servo motors move the object into the respective bin.

Applications
* Agriculture (grain sorting)
* Recycling industry
* Food processing
* Manufacturing automation
